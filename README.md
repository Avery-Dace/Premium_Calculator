# Premium_Calculator
This is a simple calculator to find the premium based on the building value, building age, building updates, location, etc. 

Techniques used to create this calculator in excel are: Data Validation (drop down), If statements, and XLOOKUP

To use this calculator:

Enter a value into the left table in the "building value" column, then going down the column, select the appropriate drop down.

You'll notice on the right table, it will automatically add the rating which adds to the premium total.

Deductible amounts will apply a discount the higher they go. See excel doc below
